Make sure no playlists are using these, and if so, set a custom schedule for them instead.\n\nIf you encounter issues where the plugin is stuck in a restart loop because of the name change, uninstall the plugin, remove the SmartPlaylist folder (there might be two, remove both) from your Jellyfin plugin folder, reboot Jellyfin and then install the plugin again\n\nIf you find any bugs, please report them here: https://github.com/jyourstone/jellyfin-smartlists-plugin/issues\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jyourstone/jellyfin-smartlists-plugin/compare/v10.11.2.0...v10.11.10.0",
